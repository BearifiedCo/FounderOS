# Products Hierarchy (Initial Blueprint)

High-level layout of the BearifiedCo portfolio to anchor future Notion databases. Detailed properties and relations will be defined in Step 2.

## Portfolio Layers

1. **Ecosystem** — BearifiedCo umbrella reporting on KPIs across all products.
2. **Products** — BEARO, AlphaBuilder, Primape, Chimpanion, future token initiatives.
3. **Sub-Programs** — Launches, growth loops, infra streams.
4. **Workstreams** — Cross-functional slices shared with Linear epics.

## Cross-Links

- Each product page references the Roadmaps DB filtered to that product.
- Contributors roll up by Workstream and Product owner.
- Observability dashboards embed Datadog widgets per product cluster.

More granular entity definitions will be captured once we move into Step 2.
