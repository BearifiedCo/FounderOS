# CRM & Contributors (Initial Blueprint)

Seed structure for the Notion CRM + contributor hub that mirrors Gmail automations and Slack onboarding flows.

## CRM View

- Leads enter via Gmail label automations.
- Key properties: Source, Stage, Product Interest, Last Touch, Next Action.
- Filtered views feed the Founder Dashboard and weekly summaries.

## Contributors View

- Unified table for full-time, part-time, contractors, and AI agents.
- Track role, repo access, Linear handle, and preferred channels.
- Connects to the Roadmaps DB via “Owner” and “Reviewer” relations.

Expanded schemas and automations will be produced in Step 2.
