# Roadmaps Database (Initial Blueprint)

Seed notes for the canonical roadmap database that will sync with Linear epics and Slack updates. Step 2 will enumerate every property and automation.

## Purpose

- Align quarterly priorities across BEARO, AlphaBuilder, Primape, Chimpanion.
- Surface status, owner, confidence, and next review date.
- Drive automations that notify agents when statuses shift.

## Core Entities (Draft)

- **Roadmap Item** — tied to Product, Objective, Linear Epic, and Observability widget.
- **Milestone** — timeboxed deliverables with owner + health score.
- **Dependency** — relation to upstream/downstream roadmap items.

Detailed schema forthcoming in the Notion architecture step.
