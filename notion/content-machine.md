# Content Machine (Initial Blueprint)

Starter outline for the Notion pipeline that turns ideas into shipped media across socials, blog, and investor updates.

## Stages

1. Idea Intake (Slack + AI summaries)
2. Draft in Progress (assign writers/agents)
3. Review & Compliance (route to Codex for checks)
4. Scheduled (sync to calendar + Buffer)
5. Posted (archive + metrics)

## Key Automations

- Linear events auto-create “Now Building” content nodes.
- GPT Agent summarizes weekly wins for newsletter drafts.
- Observability metrics (usage, revenue) injected as dynamic blocks.

Step 2 will finalize properties, rollups, and filters.
