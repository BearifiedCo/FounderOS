# Metrics & Dashboards (Initial Blueprint)

Starting point for KPI visibility. Detailed widget definitions will be drafted in Step 5.

## Core Metrics

- Activation: new projects created (AlphaBuilder), new wallets (BEARO).
- Throughput: issues completed per week per team.
- Reliability: API error rates, PDF generation success, payment settlement success.
- Revenue: GMV by product, subscription ARR (future).

## Dashboard Concepts

1. **FounderOS Command Center** — aggregates metrics above, plus OKRs.
2. **AlphaBuilder Delivery** — showcases backlog burndown + estimation cycle time.
3. **BEARO Payments Health** — payment success, settlement times, fraud alerts.

Dashboards will pipe alerts into Slack and embed into Notion dashboards.
