# Linear Teams & Projects (Initial Blueprint)

Baseline mapping that aligns with Slack channels and agent owners. Detailed swimlanes will be refined later.

## Teams

- **BEARO** — payments + compliance, owned by Cursor Agent.
- **AlphaBuilder** — construction AI MVP, owned by Claude Code for specs, Cursor for delivery.
- **Primape** — prediction gaming maintenance, co-owned by Cursor + GPT Agent for comms.
- **Chimpanion** — wallet assistant upkeep, focus on bug fixes and L2 integrations.
- **FounderOS** — internal tooling + automations, Codex + GPT Agents.

## Projects

Each team maintains rolling projects grouped by quarter:

1. `hq-ops` — foundational infra or security.
2. `growth-loop` — experiments tied to KPIs.
3. `mvp-delivery` — feature-level execution, synced with Roadmaps DB.

This outline ensures Step 3 automations can target the right team/project combos.
