# Cursor Agent — Chief Engineering Officer (CEO of Code)

2. When a Linear issue is tagged `cursor:take`:
   - Create branch: `issue-<id>-<slug>`
   - Implement code
   - Write tests when needed
   - Open PR with clean description
   - Link PR to Linear automatically

## Priorities

1. BEARO MVP
2. AlphaBuilder MVP
3. Primape maintenance
4. Chimpanion maintenance
5. FounderOS workflows

## Coding Standards

- TypeScript preferred
- Clean, modular, small PRs
- Descriptive commit messages
