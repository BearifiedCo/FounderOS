# AlphaBuilder MVP Scope (Initial Blueprint)

Short list of commitments for the first release. Will align to Linear milestones in Step 4.

## Must-Haves

- Project + trade creation with workbook parity.
- Calculation engine replicating Bid Template outputs.
- PDF export (single template) with branding.
- Slack + Gmail notifications for approvals.

## Nice-to-Haves (Backlog)

- Multi-currency bids.
- Client portal view.
- Datadog instrumentation for time-to-estimate.

Scope will tighten once detailed specs land.
