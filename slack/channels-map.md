# Slack Channels Map (Initial Blueprint)

Mapping for every operational channel so automations can route events. Detailed owners/permissions will be expanded during Step 3.

| Channel | Purpose | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- |
| #bearo-engineering | Core BEARO delivery + PR alerts | Cursor Agent |
| #alphabuilder-engineering | AlphaBuilder MVP build room | Cursor + Claude |
| #primape-support | Primape maintenance + community escalations | GPT Agent |
| #chimpanion-labs | Wallet assistant experiments | Cursor Agent |
| #founderos-ops | Cross-product coordination + announcements | GPT Agent |
| #alerts-observability | Datadog + CI/CD alerts | Codex Agent |

Additional channels (e.g., marketing, investor updates) will be cataloged as we wire automations.
